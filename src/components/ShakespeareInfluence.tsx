            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              The phrase "brave new world" itself comes from Shakespeare's play "The Tempest," where Miranda, who has grown up isolated on an island, exclaims with wonder upon seeing new people.

              This famous line captures the essence of our theme - encountering new possibilities with awe and optimism, while also reflecting on what makes a world truly "brave" and new.

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Shakespeare revolutionized language, creating new words and phrases that expanded the possibilities of expression. His mastery shows how language shapes thought and enables new worlds.

            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Just as Shakespeare's characters use language to transform their realities, we too can use language to imagine and create brave new worlds of justice and fairness.
